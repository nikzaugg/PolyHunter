# Story
An evil force has destroyed many worlds by consuming their light source. To stop the evil, someone has sent it’s helper (you) to heal the broken sun. It is the players goal to find the remnants of the light source’s fragments on the surface of the planet. If the player manages to find all light sources, the world’s sun is able to heal itself and shine bright once again. But the player has to be fast, as the darkness is taking over the planet. The player is given a limited amount of time to search through the darkness and must collect enough crystals to heal the sun. If the player fails to do so in the given time, the sun will die and the world will vanish in the darkness.
